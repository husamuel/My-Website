# About Me

I am a student at 42 Porto, where I started my journey learning programming and system administration. During the course, I developed a strong interest in cybersecurity, which led me to found the 42 Porto Cybersecurity Club to create a space for peers to learn and practice together.

My initial focus was on offensive security basics, but I am now concentrating on secure cloud infrastructure and DevSecOps. 

I hold the [**Google Cybersecurity Certificate**](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/CHBCLFOO90JB) and I am certified as a [**eJPT â€” Junior Penetration Tester**](https://certs.ine.com/ff586390-30fd-49ae-b950-4debca595dad#acc.GYTtXsbw).
