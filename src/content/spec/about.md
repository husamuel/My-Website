# About Me

I am an **aspiring Cybersecurity professional**, with a solid technical foundation built through the **42 Porto** program, an innovative coding school focused on **practical projects** and **peer-to-peer learning**. My journey began in **October 2024**, at the age of 19, and since then, I have been developing skills in **programming**, **system administration**, and **security**, with a growing passion for **ethical hacking** and **pen testing**.

## Journey at 42 Porto

At **42 Porto**, I dove into challenging projects that shaped my technical and professional mindset. Each project was an opportunity to learn, overcome obstacles, and grow, both technically and in interpersonal skills. Below, I highlight three standout experiences that illustrate my journey.

### Born2BeRoot

The **Born2BeRoot** project was my first serious exposure to **Linux system administration** and foundational **security** concepts. The task was to configure a virtual machine with strict **hardening** measures, including **separate partitions**, **LVM**, secure **sudoers** configurations, reinforced authentication, and an active **firewall with UFW**. Additionally, I had to create a **script** that displayed system information and was automatically executed by **cron**.

I spent hours studying **official documentation**, conducting manual tests, and troubleshooting to meet the project’s demanding requirements. This process was eye-opening: it taught me the importance of **attention to detail** and **patience** when working with low-level infrastructure. Successfully completing **Born2BeRoot** boosted my confidence and provided a strong foundation for exploring more advanced topics in **system security**.

### Minishell

The **Minishell** project involved building a **functional shell in C**, a minimalist replica of **bash**, with support for **multiple commands**, **redirections**, **pipes**, and **environment variables**. This was both a technical and collaborative challenge that tested my programming skills and ability to work in a team.

Initially, I faced difficulties with a partner due to issues with **communication** and **task management**, which hindered our progress. I decided to switch teams and adopt a more structured approach. With my new teammate, we established **clear communication in English** (preparing for an international career) and a work plan with **regular meetings** and a **fair division of tasks**. This change transformed the experience: we delivered a **robust and functional shell**, achieving the **maximum score**. The **Minishell** project taught me about **parsing**, **process execution**, and **memory management in C**, as well as valuable lessons in **flexibility**, **communication**, and **team responsibility**.

### Cub3D

The **Cub3D** project was, without a doubt, one of the most rewarding experiences, blending **technical challenge** with a **creative component**. The goal was to create a **3D game in C**, using **raycasting** techniques to simulate depth, inspired by the classic **Wolfenstein 3D**.

I worked in a duo with a colleague, and our collaboration was seamless from the start. We divided responsibilities clearly: I handled **rendering**, **textures**, and **map construction**, while he focused on **movement logic** and **collision detection**. We set **internal deadlines**, shared **constant feedback**, and tested each component rigorously. The result was a **functional game**, visually appealing, and built on a **well-structured codebase**. This project stood out for the **simple yet effective organization** that allowed us to achieve our goals successfully and reinforced my passion for **collaborative projects**.

## Beginning of My Cybersecurity Journey

Throughout my time at **42 Porto**, I discovered my true calling: **cybersecurity**. As a **self-learner**, I dove into studying **ethical hacking**, **pen testing**, and **web application security**, complementing my education with intensive hands-on practice.

### Cybersecurity Club

One of my proudest achievements is founding and leading the **42 Porto Cybersecurity Club**, a space where students passionate about information security come together to learn collaboratively and practically. I organize **regular sessions** with **CTF challenges**, **certification preparation**, and **technical discussions**, as well as **events with professional speakers** from national and international companies. Leading the club has been an enriching experience, challenging me to keep members motivated while navigating complex technical topics. This role has strengthened my skills in **leadership**, **communication**, **team management**, and **event organization**.

To sharpen my technical skills, I use platforms like **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**. On **Hack The Box**, I focus on **network boxes**, **Windows**, **Active Directory**, and **post-exploitation**, while on **TryHackMe**, I follow guided paths to learn new **offensive** and **defensive** techniques. I regularly participate in **CTFs** and **practical labs**, which help me identify vulnerabilities, understand how they work, and develop strategies to **mitigate** or **prevent** them. This consistent practice has been crucial for building a solid foundation in cybersecurity.

## Certifications

- [**Google Cybersecurity Certificate**](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/CHBCLFOO90JB)
- [**eJPT — Junior Penetration Tester**](https://certs.ine.com/ff586390-30fd-49ae-b950-4debca595dad#acc.GYTtXsbw)

I plan to pursue more advanced certifications to continue evolving as a cybersecurity professional.

## Outside the Technical Realm

Beyond the technical world, I stay active both mentally and physically. I regularly play **chess** on **[Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/hhugin)**, an activity that sharpens my **strategic thinking** and **creativity**. I also practice **jiu-jitsu**, which helps me cultivate **discipline**, **focus**, and **resilience**—qualities I apply to both cybersecurity and personal life. In my free time, I love participating in **CTFs (Capture The Flag)**, solving security challenges that blend **logic**, **creativity**, and **technical knowledge**.
